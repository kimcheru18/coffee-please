## Background

I really like sweet, delicious coffee and thought it would be interesting to see what kinds of coffee drinks are available around the world.

## Use Case
This app includes 20 different coffee drinks from different countries. A person can read through the description, choose a coffee they think they may like. An overlay will then show where the coffee can be found and also two YouTube videos on how to make it.

## Working Prototype

## Functionality
The app's functionality includes:
* The option to select one of 20 coffee drinks.
* The app returns a google map indicating what country the coffee originates from.
* The app returns 2 YouTube video tutorials on how to make the selected coffee.
* A 'Try another flavor' button that takes one back to the main screen.

## Technology
<h4>Front End</h4>

The app uses AJAX JSON calls to the <a href="https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search">YouTube Videos</a> *******????????Open Platform API to return the national park search results.

## Responsive
App is built to be responsive across mobile, tablet, laptop, and desktop screen resolutions.
