## Background

I really like sweet, delicious coffee and thought it would be interesting to see what kinds of coffee drinks are available around the world.

## Use Case
This app includes 20 different coffee drinks from different countries. A person can read through the descriptions, view the images and choose a coffee. An overlay will then show where the coffee can be found and also two YouTube videos on how to make it.

## Working Prototype
